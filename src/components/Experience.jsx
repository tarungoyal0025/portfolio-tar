                During my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute
                significantly to the development of a dynamic and user-friendly
                real estate website. This project allowed me to apply my skills
                in web development and gain valuable practical experience in a
                real-world setting.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collaborated with a team of developers to design and implement
                  new features for the website, enhancing its functionality and
                  user experience.

                  Utilized the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
                  Node.js) to build the frontend and backend of the application.

                <li>
                  Worked closely with UI/UX designers to ensure the website's
                  visual appeal and responsiveness met modern web standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implemented advanced search functionality, allowing users to
                  easily find properties based on various criteria such as
                  location, price range, and property type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integrated third-party APIs (MagicBricks API) to fetch
